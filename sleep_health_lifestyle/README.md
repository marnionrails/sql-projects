# Sleep, Health, and Lifestyle Analysis

This project involves both data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset focused on sleep, health, and lifestyle using MySQL Server. The goal is to prepare the dataset for accurate analysis and uncover insights into how various factors such as gender, age, occupation, and lifestyle habits influence sleep quality and related health outcomes.

## Dataset Overview

The Sleep, Health, and Lifestyle Dataset comprises 400 rows and 13 columns, covering a wide range of variables related to sleep and daily habits. It includes details such as:

- Gender
- Age
- Occupation
- Sleep Duration
- Quality of Sleep
- Physical Activity Level
- Stress Levels
- BMI Category
- Blood Pressure
- Heart Rate
- Daily Steps
- Presence or Absence of Sleep Disorders
