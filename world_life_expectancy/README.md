# World Life Expectancy Project

This project involves both data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a world life expectancy dataset using MySQL Server. The goal is to prepare the dataset for accurate analysis and uncover insights into global health trends.

## Data Cleaning

- **Objective**: Prepare the dataset by removing duplicates, filling missing values, and standardizing data formats.
- **Techniques Used**: SQL functions, window functions, and self-joins.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Objective**: Analyze trends in life expectancy, the impact of GDP, and other health indicators.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Significant increases in life expectancy over the past 15 years.
  - Strong correlation between GDP and life expectancy.
  - Differences in life expectancy between developed and developing countries.
  - - **Higher average BMI in countries correlates to longer life expectancy.**
